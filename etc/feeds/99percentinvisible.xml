<p>But the Alvord Lake Bridge is, quite literally, the bridge to the modern world. It is one the oldest reinforced concrete structures still standing. The twisted iron bars embedded in the bridge served as the model for the all the rebar containing structures that followed.

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Lawyers have an ethics code. Journalists have an ethics code. Architects do, too. According to Ethical Standard 1.4 of the American Institute of Architects (AIA):</p>
<p>&#8220;Members should uphold human rights in all their professional endeavors.&#8221;</p>
<p>A group called Architects, Designers, and Planners for Social Responsibility (ADPSR) has taken the stance that there are some buildings that just should not have been built. Buildings that, by design, violate standards of human rights.</p>
<p>Specifically, this refers to prisons with execution chambers, or prisons that are designed keep people in long-term isolation (or as prison officials call it, &#8220;segregation&#8221;). The latter kind of prison is called a &#8220;supermax,&#8221; or &#8220;security housing unit&#8221; (SHU). There is no legal definition for solitary confinement, so it&#8217;s up for debate as to whether the SHU constitutes solitary confinement.</p>
<p>There has been a lot of controversy surrounding one SHU at a Northern California prison called Pelican Bay.</p>
<p>Life inside of the SHU at Pelican Bay means 22 to 23 hours a day inside of 7.5 by 12 foot room. It&#8217;s not a space that&#8217;s designed to keep you comfortable. But it&#8217;s not just these architectural features, that concern humanitarian activists and psychiatrists. It&#8217;s the amount of time many prisoners spend in that cells, alone, without any meaningful activity. Some psychiatrists, such as Terry Kupers, say there is a whole litany of effects that a SHU can have on a person: massive anxiety, paranoia, depression, concentration and memory problems, and loss of ability to control one&#8217;s anger (which can get a prisoner in trouble and lengthen the SHU sentence). In California, SHU inmates are 33 times more likely to commit suicide than other prisoners incarcerated elsewhere in the state. There are even reports of eye damage due to the restriction on distance viewing. Terry Kupers says that a SHU &#8220;destroys people as human beings.&#8221;</p>
<p>Compared with some other prisons in the California system, the Pelican Bay SHU has some redeeming architectural features. Inmates can get natural light from skylights outside of their cells, which drifts in through doors made of a perforated metal. These porous doors also allow for inmates to communicate with each other, even though there are no lines of sight to any prisoner from within the cell.</p>
<p>But on the other hand, cells don&#8217;t have windows. Inmates never get to see the horizon. The only times prisoners get to leave the cell is to visit the shower, or the exercise yard&#8211;which is an empty, windowless room not that much bigger than a cell, with twenty-foot high concrete walls.</p>
<p>Again, there is no universally accepted definition of solitary confinement. But some groups, like Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch, have gone beyond calling the SHU solitary confinement&#8211;they call it torture. In 2011, the UN Special Rapporteur on torture said anything over 15 days in solitary confinement is a human rights abuse&#8211;which other sources have interpreted as torture.<br />
So if it is the ethical code of architects to promote human rights&#8230;what is their responsibility to the people who are incarcerated in their buildings?</p>
<p>Enter Raphael Sperry, a San Francisco-based architect and president of ADPSR. He believes it&#8217;s up to architects to lead the charge against these buildings. Sperry and the ADPSR are trying to get the American Institute of Architects to adopt an amendment to their ethics code:</p>
<p>&#8220;Members shall not design spaces intended for execution or for torture or other cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment, including prolonged solitary confinement.&#8221;</p>

"Members should uphold human rights in all their professional endeavors."

A group called Architects, Designers, and Planners for Social Responsibility (ADPSR) has taken the stance that there are some buildings that just should not have been built. Buildings that, by design, violate standards of human rights.

Specifically, this refers to prisons with execution chambers, or prisons that are designed keep people in long-term isolation (or as prison officials call it, "segregation"). The latter kind of prison is called a "supermax," or "security housing unit" (SHU). There is no legal definition for solitary confinement, so it's up for debate as to whether the SHU constitutes solitary confinement.

There has been a lot of controversy surrounding one SHU at a Northern California prison called Pelican Bay.

Life inside of the SHU at Pelican Bay means 22 to 23 hours a day inside of 7.5 by 12 foot room. It's not a space that's designed to keep you comfortable. But it's not just these architectural features, that concern humanitarian activists and psychiatrists. It's the amount of time many prisoners spend in that cells, alone, without any meaningful activity. Some psychiatrists, such as Terry Kupers, say there is a whole litany of effects that a SHU can have on a person: massive anxiety, paranoia, depression, concentration and memory problems, and loss of ability to control one's anger (which can get a prisoner in trouble and lengthen the SHU sentence). In California, SHU inmates are 33 times more likely to commit suicide than other prisoners incarcerated elsewhere in the state. There are even reports of eye damage due to the restriction on distance viewing. Terry Kupers says that a SHU "destroys people as human beings."

Compared with some other prisons in the California system, the Pelican Bay SHU has some redeeming architectural features. Inmates can get natural light from skylights outside of their cells, which drifts in through doors made of a perforated metal. These porous doors also allow for inmates to communicate with each other, even though there are no lines of sight to any prisoner from within the cell.

But on the other hand, cells don't have windows. Inmates never get to see the horizon. The only times prisoners get to leave the cell is to visit the shower, or the exercise yard--which is an empty, windowless room not that much bigger than a cell, with twenty-foot high concrete walls.

Again, there is no universally accepted definition of solitary confinement. But some groups, like Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch, have gone beyond calling the SHU solitary confinement--they call it torture. In 2011, the UN Special Rapporteur on torture said anything over 15 days in solitary confinement is a human rights abuse--which other sources have interpreted as torture.
So if it is the ethical code of architects to promote human rights...what is their responsibility to the people who are incarcerated in their buildings?

Enter Raphael Sperry, a San Francisco-based architect and president of ADPSR. He believes it's up to architects to lead the charge against these buildings. Sperry and the ADPSR are trying to get the American Institute of Architects to adopt an amendment to their ethics code:

"Members shall not design spaces intended for execution or for torture or other cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment, including prolonged solitary confinement."

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For the ancient Greeks, sirens were mythical creatures who sang out to passing sailors from rocks in the sea. Their music was so beautiful, it was said, that the sailors were powerless against it&#8211;they would turn their ships towards these sea nymphs and crash in the impassable reefs around them.</p>
<p>In Homer&#8217;s Odyssey, there&#8217;s a story where Odysseus and his men are traveling near an area that Sirens are known to inhabit. Odysseus knows that if he hears the siren&#8217;s song, his ship is going to sink. But he still wants to hear what they sound like. So he comes up with a plan: Odysseus has his men tie him to the mast of his ship so that he can&#8217;t give commands. And then Odysseus has his men fill their own ears with beeswax so they can&#8217;t hear anything. They set sail in striking distance of the sirens&#8217; call. The plan works: Odysseus gets to hear the music, his men don&#8217;t, and they sail on to safety&#8211;with Odysseus pleading with his crew to crash the boat the whole way.</p>
<p>And for the next 2000 or so years, that&#8217;s what a siren was: a creature that makes a beautiful sound.</p>
<p>But that all changed in 1819, when a French engineer named Charles Cagniard de la Tour decided to call the artificial noisemaker he was working on&#8211;the siren.</p>
<p>And this new, mechanical siren became one of THE signature sounds of the turn of the Century. Sirens warned people about immanent bombing raids during World War I. Sirens announced incoming fire engines, and ambulances, and police.</p>
<p>Thanks in part to the siren, the world of the the early 20th Century had become a lot louder than any time in human history. And we can probably assume that these sirens that people heard in cities all over the world&#8211;sounded NOTHING like the siren songs of Greek myth.</p>
<p>At least to most. One man, a composer, named Arseny Avraamov heard music in the cacophony of the modern world. And he tried to create a composition&#8211;a symphony&#8211; from the clatter of the newly formed Soviet Union.</p>
<p>Moscow-based producer Charles Maynes investigated the legend of Avraamov and his forgotten masterpiece. This is The Symphony of Sirens, Revisited.</p>
<p>This story was part of the Global Story Project, presented by PRX with support from the Open Society Foundations.</p>
<p>Plus, we hear a rebroadcast of &#8220;The Unsung Icons of Soviet Design.&#8221; (episode #25)</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Americans have always had an uneasy relationship with gambling. To circumvent anti-gambling laws in the US, early slot machines masqueraded as vending machines. They gave out chewing gum as prizes, and those prizes could be redeemed for cash.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s where the fruit logos come from. In fact, in the UK, slot machines are called &#8220;fruit machines.&#8221;</p>
<p>Despite outward appearances, slot machines have evolved dramatically since they first appeared in 1895.</p>
<p>To play the first slot machines, you slipped in a coin and pulled the lever to set the machine&#8217;s wheels in motion. The slot machine&#8217;s crank-action operation (and the way it took your money) earned it the nickname of the &#8220;one-armed bandit.&#8221;</p>
<p>But today, those hand-crank levers are uncommon, and where they do exist they are known as &#8220;legacy levers,&#8221; because they have zero relation to how the machine actually works. Everything inside a slot machine has been computerized and automated&#8211;from how you enter money, to how you bet, to how you play, to how you win and lose, and even to how you feel when leave.</p>
<p>At first, gambling machines existed at the fringes of casino culture&#8211;both figuratively and literally. The real money was in tabletop games&#8211;or so it was thought&#8211;and the slots were set up around the edges of the casino to give gamblers&#8217; wives something to do while they waited.</p>
<p>But then video technology expanded what slots could do. Now a machine could have more rows and columns than the standard three-by-three, and allowed you to place multiple bets on a single spin. A penny slot machine could let you place a hundred different one-cent bets per spin&#8211;so even if you win 40 cents on one line, and the machine congratulates you with flashing lights and chimes, you still lose 60 cents.</p>
<p>And that&#8217;s how video slots have become the most lucrative&#8211;and addictive&#8211;game in a casino.</p>

<p>The large number of hidden public staircases is part of what makes California so great. Charles Fleming is one of the world experts of coastal California&#8217;s public stairs. He has documented and mapped walking routes through nearly every useable public staircase in San Francisco&#8217;s East Bay, as well as in Los Angeles (where he lives).

      <itunes:summary>Wherever there is sufficient demand to move between two points of differing elevation, there are stairs. In some hilly neighborhoods of California--if you know where to look--you'll find public, outdoor staircases.

The large number of hidden public staircases is part of what makes California so great. Charles Fleming is one of the world experts of coastal California's public stairs. He has documented and mapped walking routes through nearly every useable public staircase in San Francisco's East Bay, as well as in Los Angeles (where he lives). Charles published his findings in two walking guides, appropriately titled Secret Stairs.

<p>There comes a time in the life of a modern city where it begins to grow up&#8211;literally. Santiago, the capital of Chile, has been going through a tremendous growth spurt since its economic boom of the mid 1990s. It happened fast. In just a few years, single family homes all over the city were replaced with high rises.</p>
<p>A man named Rodrigo Rojas played a small part in Santiagoâs &#8220;upward mobility&#8221;&#8211;which wouldnât be that remarkable if he were an engineer, a real estate developer, or an architect. But Rodrigo Rojas is a poet.</p>
<p>This is how it worked: A developer bought an old house, tore it down, and had an architect draw up plans for a high rise. And then Rodrigo stepped in to give the building a name. Rodrigo even fabricated whole stories in the service of building an identity. He came up with one story about a ship called the Zanzibar, a luxury liner built with the Titanic, but slightly smaller. You&#8217;ve never heard of it, he explained, because the Zanzibar never sank.</p>

<p>But like most legends, the one that Eric heard about the Red Car is not entirely accurate. It&#8217;s true that Los Angeles did have an extensive mass transit system called the Red Car, which at one time ran on 1,100 miles of track&#8211;about 25 percent more more track mileage than New York City has today, a century later.</p>

<p>Fourth generation UC Berkeley alum, Cyrus Farivar (see episodes #36 and #55, true believers) takes a look at the new UC identity and chronicles its tumultuous life and rapid death.

Fourth generation UC Berkeley alum, Cyrus Farivar (see episodes #36 and #55, true believers) takes a look at the new UC identity and chronicles its tumultuous life and rapid death. We also use this opportunity to ruminate on the topic of how and when a design should be judged.</itunes:summary>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When Melissa Lee was growing up in Hastings-on-Hudson, a small town in upstate New York, there were only so many fun things to do. One was buying geodes and smashing them apart with a hammer. (You know geodes, right? Those dull-looking brown rocks that you break open to reveal crystalline structures inside?)</p>
<p>One day, when Melissa was thirteen, she and her friend Liz bought some geodes. They didn&#8217;t want to wait to get home to crack them open, so they decided to throw them against the wall of an apartment building. Liz&#8217;s aim went wild, and the geode went through a window.</p>
<p>Melissa and Liz tried to find person whose window they had broken, but they couldn&#8217;t figure out which door in the apartment building lead to the unit with the window in question. Eventually they gave up.</p>
<p>Melissa would have probably forgotten about the incident had it not been for one inexplicable thing: the window didn&#8217;t get fixed. Ever.</p>
<p>It was clear that someone lived there. Melissa would walk by the window and see the apartment lit up by a TV. Someone was opening the window in the summer, and closing it in the winter. But the hole remained.</p>
<p>Melissa finished middle school, then high school, then went away to college. And when she came home and saw the window still broken, it had this effect of making her feel like the nervous, insecure thirteen year old she was when she broke the window.</p>
<p>This became a pattern for Melissa: she&#8217;d leave home, do some growing up, come home, see the window, and feel like a teenager.</p>
<p>Melissa traveled the world. She went to graduate school, She moved to Washington, DC, She got married. And every time she&#8217;d come home, she&#8217;d see the window. &#8220;As much as I was changing, this part of my past was completely frozen,&#8221; Melissa says. &#8220;As soon as I saw the window I was brought right back to those middle school days when we had broken it.&#8221;</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Kowloon Walled City was the densest place in the world, ever.</p>
<p>By its peak in the 1990s, the 6.5 acre Kowloon Walled City was home to at least 33,000 people (with estimates of up to 50,000). That&#8217;s a population density of at least 3.2 million per square mile. For New York City to get that dense, every man, woman, and child living in Texas would have to move to Manhattan.</p>
<p>To put it another way, think about living in a 1,200 square foot home. Then imagine yourself living with 9 other people. Then imagine that your building is only one unit of a twelve-story building, and every other unit is as full as yours. Then imagine hundreds those buildings crammed together in a space the size of four football fields.</p>
<p>We can&#8217;t really imagine it, either.</p>
<p>Kowloon Walled City began as a military fort in Kowloon, a region in mainland China. In 1898, China signed a land lease with Great Britain, giving the British control of Hong Kong, Kowloon, and other nearby territories. But the lease stipulated that the fort in Kowloon would remain under Chinese jurisdiction.</p>
<p>Over time, the fort became abandoned, leaving the area subject to neither Chinese nor British authority. This legal gray zone was attractive to displaced and marginalized people. Thousands of people moved there after the war with Japan broke out. Even more people moved there after the Communist Revolution. It attracted gangsters, drug addicts, sex workers, and refugees. And it also drew a lot of normal people from all over China who saw opportunity there.</p>
<p>They built the city building by building, first blanketing the area of the fort, then building vertically. Buildings were packed together so tightly in the Walled City that the alleys were nearly pitch-black in the day time. Electricity and water were brought in by illegal or informal means.</p>
<p>The Walled City gained a reputation as a sort of den of iniquity&#8211;there were high levels of prostitution, gambling, mafia activity, and, for some reason, rampant unlicensed dentistry.</p>
<p>But an order did emerge. The Walled City had no schools, but there was an informal kindergarten. A resident&#8217;s organization settled disputes. And there was lots of industry: a fishball factory, a noodle factory, metalworking shops, a textile mill. There were stores, restaurants. You could even receive mail in the Walled City.</p>
<p>Kowloon Walled City was torn down in 1993. Today, it&#8217;s a park, and most traces of the city are gone. But the memory of the city lives on. It was featured in the non-verbal film Baraka, plays a cameo role in Bloodsport. It&#8217;s also served as the setting in a number of video games, including most recently Call of Duty: Black Ops</p>
<p>This week&#8217;s episode was produced by Nick van der Kolk. He spoke with photographer Greg Girard and architect Aaron Tan, who both spent time in the Walled City. Nick also talked to as Brian Douglas, who helped design Call of Duty: Black Ops.</p>

<p>When most people think of camouflage they think of blending in with the environment, but camouflage can also take the opposite approach.</p>

<p>The strategy of this high-difference, dazzle camouflage was not about invisibility. It was about disruption. Confusion.</p>
<p>Torpedoes in the Great War could only be fired line-of-sight, so instead of firing at where they saw the ship was at that moment, torpedo gunners would have to chart out where the ship would be by the time the torpedo got there.

<p>The torpedo gunner&#8217;s margin of error for hitting a ship was quite low. Dazzle painting could throw off an experienced submariner by as much as 55 degrees.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the Cape Cod town of Woods Hole, buildings are not usually dome-shaped. Producer Katie Klocksin was pretty surprised when she came across one.</p>
<p>Katie started asking around about the dome.  She found it was built by the late Buckminster Fuller, who called himself a &#8220;comprehensive anticipatory design scientist,&#8221; out to solve the problems confronting &#8220;Starship Earth&#8221; by changing the way we make buildings.  &#8220;Bucky&#8221; Fuller invented and patented the geodesic dome, a spherical structure made from small triangles.  The design is based on a lot of complicated math, but the idea is that by relying on the strength of of the triangle, these buildings could be made from cheaper materials, like plastic and aluminum instead of steel and concrete.</p>
<p>In 1953, Fuller was commissioned to build a dome in Woods Hole by architect (and aspiring restauranteur) Gunnar Peterson.  The dome would become the posh Dome Restaurant.  Diners could gaze through the building&#8217;s triangular windows out on onto the sea.  A zither player named Ruth Welcome entertained guests.</p>
<p>Despite its Utopian aspirations, the building had some structural problems.

      <itunes:summary>In the Cape Cod town of Woods Hole, buildings are not usually dome-shaped. Producer Katie Klocksin was pretty surprised when she came across one.

Katie started asking around about the dome.  She found it was built by the late Buckminster Fuller, who called himself a "comprehensive anticipatory design scientist," out to solve the problems confronting "Starship Earth" by changing the way we make buildings.  "Bucky" Fuller invented and patented the geodesic dome, a spherical structure made from small triangles.  The design is based on a lot of complicated math, but the idea is that by relying on the strength of of the triangle, these buildings could be made from cheaper materials, like plastic and aluminum instead of steel and concrete.

In 1953, Fuller was commissioned to build a dome in Woods Hole by architect (and aspiring restauranteur) Gunnar Peterson.  The dome would become the posh Dome Restaurant.  Diners could gaze through the building's triangular windows out on onto the sea.  A zither player named Ruth Welcome entertained guests.

Despite its Utopian aspirations, the building had some structural problems.  The glass windows heated the restaurant up like a greenhouse, so the owner installed fiberglass over most of the dome, blocking the ocean views.  It leaked constantly, and was difficult to maintain.  Even though the Woods Hole dome did not radically change the world, Bucky Fuller would go on to become one of the most influential thinkers in design and architecture of the 20th Century.

Today, the Dome Restaurant lies vacant. A new development project could lead to the dome's restoration, but for now, it remains a decaying curiosity, inviting exploration from microphone-wielding out-of-towners.</itunes:summary>

<p>First up, <a href="http://www.rte.ie/digitalradio/choice/languagebites.html" target="_blank"><em>Language Bites</em></a> from RTE Choice in Ireland. <em>Language Bites</em> is a series of 1-minute programs exploring the origins of popular phrases in the English language. Itâs presented by Colette Kinsella and sound designed by Lochlainn Harte. This episode is about the origin of the word âstoreyâ (or in American English âstoryâ) when used to refer to a level of a building. There are 80 episodes in the series and I just adore them. They are in heavy rotation on the radio stream/station I curate for PRX called <a href="http://publicradioremix.org/" target="_blank">Public Radio Remix</a>.</p>
<p>Our second selection is from Nate Dimeoâs brilliant show, <em><a href="http://thememorypalace.us/" target="_blank">the memory palace</a></em>. Each episode of the memory palace features pointedly short, surprising stories about the past. Itâs sometimes heartbreaking, sometimes hysterical, and often a wonderful mix of both. It was also a huge inspiration in the creation of 99% Invisible. This episode is about the beautiful sculpture and star map commemorating the Hoover Dam.</p>]]></content:encoded>

These are the liminal spaces within cities that are not traditionally framed as âpublic spaceâ because, quite frankly, they are often ugly and unpleasant, the leftover scraps of urban design centered on the automobile. By giving these places succinct, fun and poetic names and leading people on playful walking tours, <a href="http://grahamprojects.com/" target="_blank">Graham Coreil-Allen</a> says we can help start a discourse about our public spaces and how we want to envision them for the future.

      <itunes:summary>New Public Sites is an investigation into some of the invisible sites and overlooked features of our everyday public spaces. These are the liminal spaces within cities that are not traditionally framed as âpublic spaceâ because, quite frankly, they are often ugly and unpleasant, the leftover scraps of urban design centered on the automobile. By giving these places succinct, fun and poetic names and leading people on playful walking tours, Graham Coreil-Allen says we can help start a discourse about our public spaces and how we want to envision them for the future. You can download a pdf of the New Public Sites book here.</itunes:summary>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Sean Cole is a poet and he knows what you think of that.</p>
<p>He is also a radio producer. One night, drunk and stumbling around the Hudson River with his friend Malissa OâDonnell, he discovered a monument â two of them actually â to two of his poetry heroes. Apropos of the name of this show, the tribute wasnât very obvious. In fact, he and Malissa nearly walked right past it. Still, embedded in the architecture of a 25 year old plaza were the words of Walt Whitman and Frank OâHara. And weirdly, Sean had heâd been reciting from OâHaraâs Lunch Poems just minutes before.</p>
<p>Thus began Seanâs quest to talk to the people whose idea this was â forging a largely unloved art form into a permanent fixture of the cultural landscape. Along the way he talks with urban landscape architect <a href="http://www.mpfp.com/index.shtml" target="_blank">M. Paul Friedberg</a>, former Battery Park official Richard Kahan and none other than Frank OâHaraâs younger sister, Maureen OâHara.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Whatâs the difference between what the public sees and what an architect sees when they look at a building?</p>
<p>The hotel on the very prominent corner of Touhy and Kilbourn Avenues in Lincolnwood, Illinois used to be the townâs most famous building: The first Hyatt hotel in all of Chicagoland, premiere accommodations, top-notch restaurant. It was swank! Roberta Flack stayed there. Barry Mannilow stayed there. Perry Como. Michael Jordon stayed there on his first night in Chicago. Every thirteen year old boy in the area had his bar mitzvah there.</p>
<p>Then, slowly, over time, it became Lincolnwoodâs most infamous building. Changed hands, got seedy and run down. It was the home of the Midwest Fetish Fair and Marketplace convention. There were drug-fueled sex parties attended by shady Chicago politicians later convicted of things like extortion. And of course there was the convicted mobster Alan Dorfman, who was gunned down in the parking lot. Itâs now dilapidated and empty.</p>
<p>But even if you know nothing about the history, everyone in the area knows this hotel.</p>
<p>Because itâs purple. Really, really purple.</p>
<p>Gwen Macsai grew up nearby and she always thought it was really, really ugly. Lots of people did. To be fair, <a href="http://www.savethepurple.com/" target="_blank">lots of people didnât</a>. But everyone has an opinion about it.</p>

Which is why when a company called Geico became a client everyone hoped the campaign wouldnât end up on their desk. Noel ultimately got stuck with Geico. His job was help them somehow figure out a clever, not painfully boring way to explain how simple it was for people to sign up for their insurance online.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Goethe said, âArchitecture is frozen music.â I like that.</p>
<p>Of course that was before audio recording, so now, for the most part, <em>music</em> is frozen music.</p>
<p>Itâs only very recently in the history of music that weâve been able to freeze music into an object. In my life, the form of this object mattered a lot. I once bought vinyl albums and cassette tapes, where there were two first songs per album, Side A and Side B. The energy of a first song makes it stand apart, at least in my head it does. Then the CD came along and eliminated Side B and there was only first song, and the actual number of a track (that you see prominently on the UI) became my index for sorting songs. Then MP3s jumbled my sense of track order, and albums began to feel more like a loose grouping of individual pieces rather than a conceptual whole. I could name hundreds more examples like these, and I welcome you to chime in, but my point is: the form of the thing matters.</p>
<p>But no effect has been as world changing as that original innovation: freezing music in time onto a recording, where a single version of a song, a single performance of a song, became <em>the song</em>. An inherently mutable method of communication was fundamentally changed.</p>
<p>I heard a radio broadcast several years ago that really affected the way I thought about all this. Jim Derogatis and Greg Kot are the hosts of a radio program Iâm a huge fan of called <a href="http://www.soundopinions.org/" target="_blank">Sound Opinions</a> (<a href="http://www.soundopinions.org/podcast_landing.html" target="_blank">subscribe now</a>). The songwriter, composer, and producer,<a href="http://www.soundopinions.org/shownotes/2006/070806/shownotes.html" target="_blank"> Jon Brion came to WBEZ</a> in Chicago to talk to Sound Opinions in 2006. At the time, Brion has just co-produced Kanye Westâs album Late Registration and he was also already a renowned film composer. In this interview, Brion talks about the difference between what he calls âperformance piecesâ and âsongsâ and how recorded music has changed the way we appreciate the different art forms.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If youâre a beer nerd, or have a friend whoâs a beer nerd, youâve heard of Belgian beers. Belgians take beer very seriously. Amongst the 200 Belgian breweries, thereâs a very specific sub-type: Trappist beers.</p>
<p>According to our reporter Cyrus Farivar (also from <a href="http://soundcloud.com/roman-mars/99-invisible-36-super-bon-bonn" target="_blank">Episode #36 âSuper Bonn Bonâ</a>), there are two things you need to know about Trappist beers. First, theyâre amazing. Second, theyâre made by Trappist monks. These monks trace their roots to a monastery in 17th century France, and have since spread out to all over the world.</p>
<p>The main concept behind the Trappist lifestyle is that the abbey should be economically self-sufficient. In other words, the monks should make something and sell it to the public as a way to fund the operations of the abbey itself. Some make cheese. Some make spirits. Thereâs even one in Germany that makes lentil soup. But none of the Trappist products are as famous as the beer.</p>
<p>The beer that is considered the best of the best is <a href="http://beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/313/1545" target="_blank">Westvleteren 12</a>. With its plain brown bottle, no label, the only writing is on the cap- the beer is super cool. Itâs quite rare and year after year itâs <a href="http://www.ratebeer.com/brewers/westvleteren-abdij-st-sixtus/623/" target="_blank">rated the best beer in the world</a>.</p>
<p>But hereâs the thing about Westvleteren. You canât just go there and have as much beer as you want. You canât even have it shipped from the abbey. If you want to buy beer to take with you, you have to look up the beer reservation phone number on the <a href="http://www.sintsixtus.be/eng/brouwerij.htm" target="_blank">abbeyâs website</a>. Then, you call certain phone number during certain hours, on certain days.</p>
<p>If youâre lucky enough to talk to a monk to take your reservation, you have to give your license plate number and be available to come pick up your crate during the appointed time that weekend. Youâre limited to one crate per person per car, maximum two per car. And, you canât buy more than one crate during a 60-day period. You also have to agree not to resell the beer.</p>
<p>This sort of thing is not unheard of: velvet ropes and random reward have long been imposed to create artificial scarcity to heighten demand, but the mainstream trend today seems to be more geared toward greater access and accommodation for customers. The new ideal is that everything is available, at all times, no matter where you live. Yet the Westvleteren Trappists are trying to make it as difficult as possible.</p>

No. They live between the walls of the abbey, so for them itâs not a problem.â</p>
<p>The âcustomer serviceâ is not designed to provide convenience for the consumer of their beer, it is designed for monks themselves. Their âcustomerâ is God, so to speak.

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>What happens when we build big?</p>
<p>Julia Barton remembers going to the top floor of Dallasâs then-new <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_City_Hall" target="_blank">city hall</a> when she was teenager. The building, designed by I.M. Pei, is a huge trapezoid jutting out over a wide plaza. Julia found the view from the top pretty fantastic, especially when munching on a Caramello bar from the City Hall vending machines.</p>
<p>But once she went to a protest in the plaza below. And those same windows, now hulking over her, made her feel small, and the whole event insignificant. Texans have a fondness for big structuresâbig <a href="http://stadium.dallascowboys.com/" target="_blank">arenas</a>, big <a href="http://southfork.com/" target="_blank">houses</a>, big <a href="http://www.texasfreeway.com/dallas/photos/north_dallas_aerial/north_dallas_aerial.shtml" target="_blank">freeways</a>. Julia wasnât sure if their hidden message wasnât simply this: Iâm important, youâre nobody.</p>
<p>For people who distrust the big project, Edward Tennerâs 2001 essay â<a href="http://www.edwardtenner.com/the_xanadu_effect_21105.htm" target="_blank">The Xanadu Effect</a>â is some comfort. Tenner, a visiting scholar at Princeton University, ponders the ways in which obsession with bigness can presage hard times for a business or even a nation. Tenner named his essay not for Olivia Newton-Johnâs <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiCYeaMJdEQ&amp;feature=related" target="_blank">anthem</a> or even the Coleridge <a href="http://www.poetry-online.org/coleridge_kubla_khan.htm" target="_blank">poem</a>, but for the palace <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xanadu_%28Citizen_Kane%29" target="_blank">Xanadu</a> built in the movie âCitizen Kane.â That Xanadu, of course, was based on a real-life palace that newspaper mogul William Randolph Hearst built in his waning days of empire:</p>
<blockquote><p>On its 24,000 acres were a 354,000-gallon swimming pool, a private zoo and four main buildings with a total of 165 rooms. Along with other such extravagances, the estate helped send Hearst into trusteeship late in life. The cavernous halls of Wellesâ gloomy cinematic Xanadu seemed to filmgoers â as the real, happier building must have appeared to many Hearst Corp. public investors â the very image of the pride that goes before a fall.</p></blockquote>
<p>The downside of the Xanadu Effect has seen itself play out in other placesâthe Empire State Building, for example, was conceived in the 1920s but completed during the Great Depression, when it was known as âthe Empty State Building.â Tennerâs not arguing that big things shouldnât be built; heâs saying bigness is a gamble. It pays off when it it uplifts people, gives them a sense of grandeur and purpose. It fails when it crushes them or just makes life a pain, as in the big-built city of Moscow, where pedestrians have to scurry under the wide avenues in tunnels.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On a recent reporting trip to Russia for <a href="http://www.theworld.org/" target="_blank">PRIâs âThe World</a>,â Julia travelled to Sochi, Russiaâs southern-most city and upcoming host of the 2014 Winter Olympics. Sochi is Europeâs biggest construction site right now, with Xanadu-like ice-palaces going up right on the Black Sea.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All the constructionâincluding billions of dollars of infrastructureâis good news for the Russian state and shoring up its presence in the Caucasus. Itâs not necessarily good news for the locals. Julia interviewed a Sochi resident, Alexei Kravets, whoâs been in a stand-off with authorities about the fate of the home he built by the Black Sea.</p>
<p>Kravetsâs court case to save his home has been standing in the way of a new railway complex. Construction workers have been throwing rocks through his windows, scraping his walls with backhoes, and hauling away his storage units. Kravets has been confronting them on film.</p>
<p>Itâs a dramatic example of big vs. small, but this type of conflict often happens in the face of massive development. Edward Tenner says beyond just governments or private developers, we all need to think more carefully about the costs and benefits of building big.</p>
<p>âBigness is a strategy that just about always fails, unless it succeeds. Or you could say it always succeeds except when it fails. And there really is no one way that you can regard it. You have to see it as a very powerful, easy-to-misuse, but also tempting way to go about things in life,â he says.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Even during the construction of the original Tacoma Narrows Bridge, the deck would go up and down by several feet with the slightest breeze. Construction workers on the span chewed on lemon wedges to stop their motion sickness. They nicknamed the structure Galloping Gertie.</p>
<p>The original Tacoma Narrows Bridge design by Clark Eldridge was pretty conventional for a suspension bridge, but it was later modified by Leon Moisseiff to be slimmer and more elegant. The most notable change was that the 25 foot lattice of stiffening trusses underneath the bridge on the original drawings, were replaced with 8 foot solid steel plate girders. The new solid girder along the side in Moisseiffâs design made for a much lighter and more flexible bridgeâ it also caught the wind like a sailâ but they didnât know that. Moisseiffâs design was also 2/3 the price of the original Eldridge design and that fact ultimately won the day.</p>

      <itunes:summary>Even during the construction of the original Tacoma Narrows Bridge, the deck would go up and down by several feet with the slightest breeze. Construction workers on the span chewed on lemon wedges to stop their motion sickness. They nicknamed the structure Galloping Gertie.

The original Tacoma Narrows Bridge design by Clark Eldridge was pretty conventional for a suspension bridge, but it was later modified by Leon Moisseiff to be slimmer and more elegant. The most notable change was that the 25 foot lattice of stiffening trusses underneath the bridge on the original drawings, were replaced with 8 foot solid steel plate girders. The new solid girder along the side in Moisseiffâs design made for a much lighter and more flexible bridgeâ it also caught the wind like a sailâ but they didnât know that. Moisseiffâs design was also 2/3 the price of the original Eldridge design and that fact ultimately won the day.

Motorists who used the bridge found out first hand why it got the name Galloping Gertie, and during the four months while the bridge was open, many traveled from far away just to ride the undulating waves as they crossed high above Puget Sound. The thrill ride didnât last long.

<p>-Ethel Kessler, Art Director for USPS Stamp Services</p></blockquote>
<p>Stamps design takes, on average, a year to a year and a half, from conception to execution. Unfortunately, most of the stamps we encounter on a day-to-day basis are the rather predictable flag, bell, and love stamps, but there are some really fantastic commemorative stamps, which are supremely functional and affordable tiny works of art.</p>
<p>To determine what should go on a US stamp, the Citizens Stamp Advisory Committee combs through nearly 50,000 suggestions per year offered by the general public. Once the subjects are chosen and approved by the Postmaster General, they are assigned to a handful of art directors to be designed.</p>
<p>There are loads guidelines to help stamp subject selection, but one of the big rules recently changed. In 2012, the first living person will be commemorated on an official USPS stamp.</p>

-Ethel Kessler, Art Director for USPS Stamp Services
Stamps design takes, on average, a year to a year and a half, from conception to execution. Unfortunately, most of the stamps we encounter on a day-to-day basis are the rather predictable flag, bell, and love stamps, but there are some really fantastic commemorative stamps, which are supremely functional and affordable tiny works of art.

To determine what should go on a US stamp, the Citizens Stamp Advisory Committee combs through nearly 50,000 suggestions per year offered by the general public. Once the subjects are chosen and approved by the Postmaster General, they are assigned to a handful of art directors to be designed.

There are loads guidelines to help stamp subject selection, but one of the big rules recently changed. In 2012, the first living person will be commemorated on an official USPS stamp.

Julie Shapiro, Artistic Director of the Third Coast International Audio Festival, produced this episode. Julie spoke with Terry McCaffrey, the retired manager of stamp development for the USPS Stamp Services Office, and Ethel Kessler, an Art Director whoâs been working with Stamp Services for over 15 years.</itunes:summary>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Before the 1850s, dentures were made out of very hard, very painful and very expensive material, like gold or ivory. They were a luxury item. The invention of Vulcanite hard rubber changed everything. It was moldable, it could be precisely fitted, and it was relatively cheap. Everyone began making dentures with Vulcanite bases. But in 1864, a long disputed patent application, originally filed in 1852, was awarded and then acquired by the Goodyear Dental Vulcanite Company. It was an outfit created to collect fees, or very often, sue dentists who already used vulcanite, and there were plenty of dentists to go after.</p>
<p>The person in charge of pursuing the violators was Josiah Bacon, the treasurer of the Goodyear Dental Vulcanite Company. The patent was enforced with extreme prejudice, despite the protestations of the US dental profession.</p>
<p>To quote the secretary of the Goodyear Dental Vulcanite Company, Ernest Caduc: âMany dentistsâ¦relying upon the secret nature of the business, prefer to steal this property rather than buy itâ¦â</p>
<p>It all came to a head on Easter Sunday in 1879. A Vulcanite denture patent violating dentist named Samuel Chalfant went to settle his business with his pursuer, Josiah Bacon, in his San Francisco hotel room. Chalfant brought a gun.</p>

They have released two EPs (<a href="http://www.dischord.com/release/128-5/cigarette-girl-from-the-future" target="_blank"><em>The Cigarette Girl From the Future</em></a> and <a href="http://www.dischord.com/release/138/you-are-right-to-be-afraid" target="_blank"><em>You Are Right to be Afraid</em></a>) and their last album, <a href="http://www.dischord.com/release/139/the-unsustainable-lifestyle" target="_blank"><em>The Unsustainable Lifestyle</em></a>, came out in 2004.</p>
<p>In the interim, the singer/guitarist/producer for Beauty Pill, Chad Clark, got very sick and nearly died. That can be enough to make anyone stop making music, but in Clarkâs case, he continued to make music, but he just never felt the need to release a record or play live. His music was just for him and his friends, and that was OK.</p>
<p>But a strange confluence of opportunity, desire and architecture knocked Beauty Pill out of their unforced exile. The curators at a new multimedia art center called <a href="http://artisphere.com/calendar/event-details/Visual-Arts/IMMERSIVE-IDEAL.aspx" target="_blank">Artisphere</a> invited Chad Clark to come in and do something musical in the space. While they were showing him around, he saw the angled, 2nd floor window overlooking the Black Box Theater and it reminded him of the window in <a href="http://www.abbeyroad.com/Studio/6/Studio-Two" target="_blank">Abbey Road Studio 2</a>, made famous by The Beatles. Months later, the Black Box Theater was transformed into a very public recording studio, capturing the sounds and energy of the band, onlookers and guests over the course of a couple weeks.</p>

The water shoots out at various angles, from inside a sunken pit, filled with large granite slabs.

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Itâs hard to imagine a place where more desperate and depressing drama unfolds on a daily basis than a family courthouse- custody battles, abuse, divorce- and if you were to design a place to reflect and amplify that misery, not mitigate it, itâd probably take the form of the old New York County Family Courthouse in Lower Manhattan.</p>
<p>The original shiny black cube, built in 1975, was referred to as the âDarth Vader buildingâ by court employees (presumably after 1977). The foreboding and intimidating structure is primarily criticized in relation to its function as a family courthouse, which should strive to inspire a feeling of trust, authority, and (one hopes) inclusion.</p>
<p>The building was remodeled in 2006. The bones are largely the same, but the shiny, black cladding is gone, replaced by a more conventional grey/beige. The problematic entrance to the building has been completely opened up, making ingress and egress a much less daunting proposition. To quote our 99% Invisible reporter this week, <strong>Brett Myers</strong>, âwalking into the building is no longer like being consumed by a beast.â</p>
<p>But a little something was lost in the facelift. The original building was definitely not boring and commanded your attention. I donât know if the same can be said for the current design.

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If I asked you to close your eyes and mimic the action of using one of the simple human interfaces of everyday life, you could probably do it. Without having a button to push, you could close your eyes and pretend push a button, and that action would accurately reflect the action of pushing a real button. The same goes for flipping a switch or turning a door knob. If you closed your eyes and faked the movement, it would sync up with its real world use.</p>
<p>Now if I asked you to do the same with a carâs steering wheel, youâd think youâd be able to describe steering accurately and mime the correct movements with your hands in the air, but youâd be wrong. Very, very wrong. Youâd probably kill a bunch of imaginary people.</p>
<p>Our friends at <a href="http://humansindesign.com/" target="_blank">Humans in Design</a>, Tristan Cooke and Tom Nelson, bring us this story about how our brain knows how to steer without really knowing how to steer, and what that means for steering wheel design. They interviewed <a href="http://www.hms.uq.edu.au/steven-cloete" target="_blank">Dr. Steve Cloete</a>, from The University of Queensland, who conducted the awesome blind driver studies.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <itunes:summary>If I asked you to close your eyes and mimic the action of using one of the simple human interfaces of everyday life, you could probably do it. Without having a button to push, you could close your eyes and pretend push a button, and that action would accurately reflect the action of pushing a real button. The same goes for flipping a switch or turning a door knob. If you closed your eyes and faked the movement, it would sync up with its real world use.

Now if I asked you to do the same with a carâs steering wheel, youâd think youâd be able to describe steering accurately and mime the correct movements with your hands in the air, but youâd be wrong. Very, very wrong. Youâd probably kill a bunch of imaginary people.

Our friends at Humans in Design, Tristan Cooke and Tom Nelson, bring us this story about how our brain knows how to steer without really knowing how to steer, and what that means for steering wheel design. They interviewed Dr. Steve Cloete, from The University of Queensland, who conducted the awesome blind driver studies.</itunes:summary>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you look at the outer hull of commercial ships, you might find a painted circle bisected with a long horizontal line. This marking is called the load line, or as I prefer, the Plimsoll line. This simple graphic design has saved thousands of lives. The Plimsoll line shows the maximum loading point of the ship and lets a third party know, plainly and clearly, when a vessel is overloaded and at risk of sinking in rough seas. If you see that horizontal line above the water, youâre good, if you donât, you could be sunk.</p>
<p>The load line was named after the crusading British MP Samuel Plimsoll. The advent of insurance in the 19th century, created an incentive for ship owners to purposely sink their own ships and collect the insurance money. This grim practice became so widespread, and killed so many merchant seamen, that the over-insured, overloaded vessels became known as âcoffin ships.â Samuel Plimsoll (âthe sailors friendâ) fought for sweeping merchant shipping regulation that led to the adoption of the marking that bears his name.</p>
<p>Tristan Cooke, a human factors engineer and creator of a great blog called <a href="http://humansindesign.tumblr.com/" target="_blank">Humans in Design</a>, tells us the history of the Plimsoll line and explains why itâs one of his favorite examples of design.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://feltron.com/" target="_blank">Nicholas Felton</a> is an information designer. Since 2005, he has tabulated thousands upon thousands of tiny measurements in his life and designed stunning graphs and maps and created concise infographics that detail that yearâs activities. The results were originally intended for his friends and family, but the â<a href="http://feltron.com/ar09_01.html" target="_blank">personal annual reports</a>â have found an audience with fellow designers and people that really geek out on seeing lots of data, beautifully presented.</p>
<p>In 2010, Nicholas Feltonâs father passed away, and Felton decided to turn his annual report into a full biography of his father. He took 4,348 of his fatherâs personal records and created an <a href="http://feltron.com/ar10_01.html" target="_blank">intimate portrait</a> of a man, using only the data he left behind.</p>
<p>I produced this story with <a href="http://nate-berg.com/" target="_blank">Nate Berg</a>, who is an awesome freelance journalist and blogger at <a href="http://www.planetizen.com/" target="_blank">Planetizen</a> (a site you should add to your daily routine).</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <itunes:summary>Nicholas Felton is an information designer. Since 2005, he has tabulated thousands upon thousands of tiny measurements in his life and designed stunning graphs and maps and created concise infographics that detail that yearâs activities. The results were originally intended for his friends and family, but the âpersonal annual reportsâ have found an audience with fellow designers and people that really geek out on seeing lots of data, beautifully presented.

In 2010, Nicholas Feltonâs father passed away, and Felton decided to turn his annual report into a full biography of his father. He took 4,348 of his fatherâs personal records and created an intimate portrait of a man, using only the data he left behind.

I produced this story with Nate Berg, who is an awesome freelance journalist and blogger at Planetizen (a site you should add to your daily routine).</itunes:summary>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In 1998 Dr. Gary Kaplan, the CEO of Virginia Mason Medical Center in Seattle received some bad news about his hospital. It was losing money. So Dr. Kaplan started studying how other hospitals were being run to see if there was a better way to manage his hospital. He scoured the country, looking for a hospital with a management system worth adopting, but he never found one. Instead he ended up in Japan. At a Toyota factory. This entire, multiyear overhaul started with a ball of blue yarn. The staff met with a Toyota Production System sensei and he took out the ball of blue yarn and a map of the hospital and told the staff to trace the path a cancer patient would take on a typical visit for chemotherapy treatment. When they were finished, it was an immensely powerful visual experience for everyone in the room. They all stared at this map with blue yarn snaking all over the place, doubling back on itself and making complicated twists and turns from one end of the building to the other. They understood for the first time that they were taking their sickest patients, for whom time was their most precious resource, and they were wasting huge amounts of it.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When people critique cul-de-sacs, a lot of the time, theyâre actually critiquing the suburbs more generally. The cul-de-sac has become sort of like the mascot of the suburbsâ like if suburbia had a flag, it would have a picture of a cul-de-sac on it. Cul-de-sacs by definition arenât well connected to other streets and they are far away town centers. People can argue whether or not these are pros or cons, depending on what lifestyle choices they prioritize. For little kids, cul-de-sacs can be great, but they do have some real, quantifiable design flaws. Imagine being a garbage collector, or a street cleaner, instead of driving down one long street and collecting all the garbage from that street, then taking a right onto the next street and so on, you have to turn around in all of these cul-de-sacs over and over again. It takes more time and uses more gas. Theyâre expensive for governments to maintain, and now, governments are starting to enact regulations against them. Producer <a href="http://katiemingle.com/" target="_blank">Katie Mingle</a> talks with <a href="http://www-personal.umich.edu/%7Emlassite/homepage.html" target="_blank">Matt Lassiter</a> about cul-de-sacs, the pitfalls of suburban design, and of course, E.T.</p>]]></content:encoded>

These rules dictated that if silk magnate John Noble Stearns wanted to build one of those ten story towers that were all the rage in 1888, on his 22 foot wide lot, he would need to build walls of stone and brick that were 5 feet thick. With tiny windows. Which left room for an interior that was only 11 feet wide. Slice off a few feet for a hallway. A few for a bathroom.A couple for a coat closet. Another for some filing cabinets and an umbrella stand. And he would be asking his well heeled tenants to work in a dark cell better suited to monks illuminating manuscripts. Stearns asked the best architects in the northeast for a solution. They all told him it couldnât be done. Everyone except Bradford Gilbert.

      <itunes:summary>Thereâs something that links most of the everyday objects presented in âMade in Russia: Unsung Icons of Soviet Design.â But itâs hard to tell exactly what that is just by looking at this collection of wobbly dolls, drinking glasses, primitive arcade games, and arsonistic space heaters. The essence, argues editor Michael Idov, is the system that built them: a post-WWII economy, mostly closed from the rest of the world, trying to transform its tank and grenade factories into places that churned out Western-style consumer goods. Idov grew up in Soviet Latvia with âsome pretty terrible stuff,â but he believes the experience makes him, and other Soviet citizens, hyperaware of good design when they see it. Julia Barton explores the good, the bad, and the weird products of the former empire.</itunes:summary>

Eisenhower, you saw the solemn oath of office taken between twenty-two smooth, sandstone columns at the East Portico of the U.S. Capitol Building. The slabs that made up the columns were considered so important that when they were transported from a barge on the Potomac River to Capitol Hill in 1824, they were pulled by man power alone, because lowly mules were deemed unfit to move such sacred objects. The columns did not have the same standing in 1958. During the renovation of the East Portico, the columns were removed, crated and stored, until a couple of women fought to put them back on their feet in the National Arboretum. Other parts of the faÃ§ade were also carted away in the renovation, but they didnât get quite the same treatment. The episode was produced by Sam Greenspan and Jess Schreibstien, with help from Melissa Lee and John Asante.

The combination of the police scanner and ambient music is an intriguing, and distinctly live, experience (unlike most of the time shifted audio I tend to consume). Its other appeal is its simple and elegant execution. There are three component parts: a police radio stream from Radio Reference (radioreference.com), a pre-screened ambient music playlist from <a href="http://soundcloud.com/" target="_blank">SoundCloud</a>, and a cool photo from <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hyperbolation/5331550248/" target="_blank">Flickr</a>. Each element is from some other source, that never could have envisioned that this is the way their content would be used. This is the power of a sharable and mashable web. As a bonus this week, Iâve added a story I did in 2005 about another radio obsession of mine called Radio Net. For two hours on 200 NPR stations in 1977, sound artist <a href="http://www.max-neuhaus.info/audio-video/" target="_blank">Max Neuhaus</a> conducted a massive, experimental audio symphony using processed sound from callers all around the nation.

The winning design, created by <a href="http://www.greenmuseum.org/content/artist_index/artist_id-51.html" target="_blank">Mark Brest van Kempen</a> (who was then a graduate student at the San Francisco Art Institute), is an invisible sculpture that creates a small space completely free from laws or jurisdiction. The six inch circle of soil, and the âfreeâ column of airspace above it, is framed by a six foot granite circle. The inscription on the granite reads, âThis soil and the air space extending above it shall not be a part of any nation and shall not be subject to any entityâs jurisdiction.â The six inch free space acts as a beacon for speakers and political events.

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In a <a href="http://urbanomnibus.net/2011/02/liberation-squares/" target="_blank">recent piece</a> from <a href="http://urbanomnibus.net/" target="_blank">Urban Omnibus</a>, Vishaan Chakrabarti (Professor at the Graduate School for Architecture, Planning and Preservation at Columbia University), wrote about how urban open spaces contribute to political change, âPublic spaces like Tompkins Square, Tiananmen Square and Tahrir Square have been stages for history because they provide the loci for urban gathering, particularly for a cityâs youthâ¦One could argue that without cities and the spaces they inspire, nations themselves would never change.â Host of <a href="http://wfmu.org/playlists/TI" target="_blank">WFMUâs Too Much Information</a>, Benjamen Walker, took a walk with Chakrabarti down to Tompkins Square Park to talk about the past and present design of the space and how the layout has affected the public actions that have taken place there. Chakrabarti also relates this to the current protests in the Middle East. Twitter and Facebook may have had a significant role in organizing the protests, but if there is no place for everyone to gather, what possible change can result?</p>
<p>For you podcast listeners (and website streamers) Iâve also added a very 99% Invisible excerpt from Benjamen Walkerâs brilliant radio program Too Much Information. This is a piece called âNew York Dickâ from the <a href="http://wfmu.org/playlists/shows/38878" target="_blank">What A Difference Makes</a> episode from Jan 17, 2011. Enjoy!</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A few years ago, journalist <a href="http://www.douglasmcgray.com/" target="_blank">Douglas McGray</a> learned that the largest chain of check cashing stores in Southern California, Nix Check Cashing, was being bought by the nationâs largest credit union, Kinecta. The credit union thought it had something to learn from the check casher about how to reach out and serve the poor. This was curious. McGrayâs impression was that check cashers (and especially payday lenders) were predatory, the bad guys, and that credit unions, especially one dedicated to serving the poor, were the good guys. This proposed sale made McGray look at the whole situation with fresh eyes.</p>
<p>I highly recommend reading Douglas McGrayâs <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/09/magazine/09nix-t.html?_r=2&amp;ref=business&amp;pagewanted=all&amp;oref=slogin" target="_blank">New York Times Magazine article</a> all about it. Itâs excellent.</p>
<p>I, of course, was drawn to the design aspects of the story.</p>
<p>Check cashing stores can feel very odd when youâre not used to them. Quite simply, they are often designed to look and feel more like a corner store. The furnishings are sparse, and the information is on signsâ big, bold and clearly presented. Banks, on the other hand, have a design legacy of carpeting, heavy desks, suits, and pamphlets that are hard to parse. If you were to start over and design a financial products retail location today, which model would you follow?</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The idea is simple and quite beautiful: if we all shared a second, politically neutral language, people of all different nations and cultures could communicate freely and easily, and it would foster international understanding and peace. This is the idea behind the invention of Esperanto. It was a linguistic solution to what seemed like a linguistic problem. Esperanto may not have achieved the goal of ubiquity and international peace, but it has become the most widely spoken constructed language in the world. Much of its success has to do with its design as a language. The grammar is very regular and easy to learn, but it also has a flexible and poetic nature that facilitates wordplay and artistic expression.</p>

<p>I like McLennanâs definition of sustainable design because itâs broken into two parts (1) minimizing negative impact, and (2) maximizing quality. Minimizing the negative is a given that I think everyone understands (and is absolutely critical, no doubt), but itâs the aspect of sustainable design that is also seeking to âmaximize the quality of the built environmentâ that I find really inspiring. That is what intrigued me about <a href="http://www.civiltwilightcollective.com/" target="_blank">Civil Twilightâs</a> <a href="http://www.civiltwilightcollective.com/lunar1.htm" target="_blank">Lunar-resonant Streetlights</a>.

The signage can be indecipherable. As a point of interaction with your municipality, itâs just a nightmare. Plus, from an urban planning perspective, the spaces themselves are a horribly mismanaged city resource. A new pilot program in San Francisco is looking to change all that. <a href="http://sfpark.org/" target="_blank">SFPark</a> is trying to use smart parking to make a smarter and better designed city. This episode features Jay Primus, Manager of the SFPark project and <a href="http://shoup.bol.ucla.edu/" target="_blank">Donald Shoup</a>, author of the highly influential book called, <em>The High Cost of Free Parking.</em></p>]]></content:encoded>

      <itunes:summary>Itâs weird how much anxiety comes from parking in a city. Beyond the stress of looking for parking, you must contend with the frequently unreliable meters. The signage can be indecipherable. As a point of interaction with your municipality, itâs just a nightmare. Plus, from an urban planning perspective, the spaces themselves are a horribly mismanaged city resource. A new pilot program in San Francisco is looking to change all that. SFPark is trying to use smart parking to make a smarter and better designed city. This episode features Jay Primus, Manager of the SFPark project and Donald Shoup, author of the highly influential book called, The High Cost of Free Parking.</itunes:summary>
